The complexities of exterior gateway protocols, including TCP connections, message states, path attributes, interior routing protocol interoperation, and setting up neighbor connections, require a comprehensive understanding of router operations in order to manage network growth. Routing TCP/IP, Volume II, provides you with the expertise necessary to understand and implement BGP-4, multicast routing, Network Address Translation, IPv6, and effective router management techniques. Jeff Doyle's practical approach, easy-to-read format, and comprehensive topic coverage make this book an instant classic and a must-have addition to any network professional's library.

Routing TCP/IP, Volume II expands upon the central theme of Volume I: scalability and management of network growth. Volume II moves beyond the interior gateway protocols covered in Volume I to examine both inter-autonomous system routing and more exotic routing issues such as multicasting and IPv6. This second volume follows the same informational structure used effectively in Volume I: discussing the topic fundamentals, following up with a series of configuration examples designed to show the concept in a real-world environment, and relying on tested troubleshooting measures to resolve any problems that might arise. Designed not only to help you walk away from the CCIE lab exam with one of those valued and valuable numbers after your name, this book also helps you to develop the knowledge and skills essential to a CCIE. Whether you are pursuing CCIE certification, need to review for your CCIE recertification exam, or are just looking for expert-level advice on advanced routing issues, Routing TCP/IP, Volume II helps you understand foundation concepts and apply best practice techniques for effective network growth and management.
